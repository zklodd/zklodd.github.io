        <p>Hello, my name is Zachary Klodd, I am a current transfer student pursuing my Senior year at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee for Computer Science, Bachelor of Arts.&nbsp; 
                I have aspired to be a programmer in the software engineering field ever since I started high school, I've thoroughly enjoyed the problem-solving and real-world impact
                I can provide to the community when it comes to programming. I'm always looking to take on new internship opportunities any chance I get, I really enjoy learning new things 
                and being able to apply my experiences to companies that need my development skills. I chose to attend UWM because I was orginally at Gateway Technical College in Racine, 
                here I was able to receive my associate's degree in software development, as well as being able to take a program at UWM that would allow me to transfer every credit I've earned from Gateway to UWM. 
                Because of this I will only need to attend UWM for two years instead of a usual four, for a bachelor's degree. This helped me fastrack my life and get started on opportunities much 
                sooner than I was expecting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
