        <p>This class covers intricate Java based programming. So far it has specifically been focusing on abstract data types and generic types. It is a very difficult class that uses advanced logic to create linked lists using iterators, nodes, and dynamic arrays. This class heavily revolves around group work on labs to work together to try and come up with solutions to problems provided, this labs help students stay prepared for upcoming assignments that revolve around the same topic as well as quizzes during lectures.</p><p>With this in mind, a recent group lab project I had worked on was focused on the idea of linked lists using nodes, basically, one "node" contains "data" and a "next" variable. The "next" variable then points to the next "node" which will once again form the same type of data as the previous one, this "chain" will then form a list. This lab in particular introduces the idea and helps provide visualization of it, me and my group had to work together to understand the concept of how a node list would communicate with itself when a new node is added in particular parts of the list, as well as when nodes are removed, afterwards, the program wasn't running as expected and we had to work together to debug the issue and allow the GUI to run properly.</p>
