        <p>Infoview Systems is a application development company that helps develop user interfaces for customers from all over the IBM I systems category the main portion I worked in was the company's personal GUI interface that revolved around keeping libararies and journals to track records of data in large lists. I worked together with one other partner and we would often work together to help debug and implement new parts of the application. Majority of the time we would work in an IBM I proprietary code called RPGIV, and we were also being introduced to the Mulesoft software platform at the same time.</p><p>Due to Non-disclosure agreements, I will not discuss too deeply what specifically the code did, but one of the projects we needed to do involved creating "test cases" for every instance of input our GUI could receive. It involved large amounts of teamwork and documentation due to the numerous amounts of combinations of inputs there could be, as well as many different ways the interface could potentially be mishandled by a user accidentally. These test cases would further help any new changes that have been made to be more secure as after each change we would check them against the test cases to ensure security.</p><p>Another, more, programming-heavy project me and a team did at Infoview Systems was fix the communication between the DBMS and the AS/400 computer. In short, old data in the system had a "date created" field that would help determine if a piece of data was considered "old." Any data that surpassed a time of a month or two would then be automatically removed from the system to keep it maintained and memory low. However, under certain circumstances, this date field would be ignored and data would never be removed, me and my partner had to work together to try and figure out why this field would be ignored and required immense amounts of debugging and communication between us. In the end, we were able to solve the issue and keep the consistency of the machine in a stable state again.</p>
