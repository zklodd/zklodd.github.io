        <ul><li>WMCPA - Wisconsin Midrange Computer Professional Association<ul><li>This association has an annual meeting where a large number of companies and schools that revolve around the IBM field of computer science will come together and present new applications, software updates, and even teach students new topics and ideas that may not be covered in school. I attended this meeting in the spring of 2022 when I was at Gateway Techincal College, it had a reverse career fair in it as well and I was able to talk to many different representatives of companies.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Gateway Techincal College didn't have that many organizations or opportunities to help expand this area, but since I am new to UWM, my mentor has shown me many potential things that I can do at UWM in the computer science area that can help develop this part of the portfolio. I believe that these organizations will help me be more comfortable on campus and getting to expand my connections in the field is always very important.</p>
